# TypeAhead/AutoCompletion System

    1. Functional Requirements

Users type a query and get real-time suggestions.

Suggestions are ranked based on popularity, relevance, and personalization.

Support for multi-language queries.

Misspelling correction (e.g., "gogle" â†’ "google").

Support for trending searches and context-aware suggestions.

    2. Non-Functional Requirements

Low latency: Responses should be within 100-200ms.
Scalability: Handle millions of concurrent users.

High availability: 99.99% uptime.

Fault tolerance: Prevent downtime in case of failures.

Consistency vs. Performance trade-off: Real-time 

updates vs. caching.

    3. High-Level Architecture
    Components

    Client (Frontend)

    Sends requests on keypress.

    Displays ranked suggestions.

    Load Balancer
    Distributes requests across backend servers.

    Search Suggestion Service

    Fetches results from cache or database.
    Ranks and filters the suggestions.
    Auto-Suggestion Engine

    Uses Trie, Inverted Index, or Fuzzy Matching for fast lookups.
    Incorporates ML-based ranking models.
    Cache Layer (Redis/Memcached)

    Caches frequent queries for faster responses.
    Search Index (Elasticsearch, Apache Solr)

    Stores and indexes past queries, trending searches, and results.
    Database (NoSQL + SQL Hybrid)

    Stores user-specific search history (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).
    Stores search metadata (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    Logging & Analytics

    Collects user interaction data for popularity scoring.
